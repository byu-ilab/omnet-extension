things to do:

+- make an omnetextension repository
+- instrument the code to use the signals framework
+	clean it up
+- document how to use the dynamic stats recorders

- make an omnet repository?
- add vector selection to the vector recorders
- instrument the regular recorders to understand a DynamicResultValue or at least an EncapsulatedValue?
- merge the inet, emulation, movesims, extension repositories?
